# SipNShow #

We created SipNShow to link users with their favorite musician's concerts and a nearby local brewery.

# Motivation #

We created this application to help the user find an event featuring their favorite band or artist along with a local brewery to visit before or after the show.

# Build Status #

Deployed with a laundry list of great ideas for future development.

You can find the project here: https://kmwine02.github.io/project01/

# Screenshots #

See below for an example of the artist search page results with local storage populating the recent searches underneath the submit button;

When the show is chosen, the user can click the "Find a Brewery" button and results will populate. See below;

# Future Features #

Here are some future features we would like to implement in order to greatly improve the user experience;

- search for artists by genre
- create the ability to search for international venues and breweries
- add logos and/or pictures of the brewery, artist and concert venue to the search results
- a "save trip" function when the user finds a combination of venue & brewery to attend
- pagination for search results
