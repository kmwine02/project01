# SipNShow #

We created SipNShow to link users with their favorite musician's concerts and a nearby local brewery.

# Motivation #

We created this application to help the user find an event featuring their favorite band or artist along with a local brewery to visit before or after the show.

# Build Status #

TBD (Completed, duh)

# Screenshots #

~ ~ coming soon ~ ~

# Framework Used #

- Bootstrap
- jQuery

# Features #

One of the defining features of our application is the ability to link a concert venue with a nearby local brewery.

# Future Features #

Here are some future features we would like to implement in order to greatly improve the user experience;

- utilize maps to navigate between concert venues and breweries
- search for artists by genre
- create the ability to search for international venues and breweries
- add logos and/or pictures of the brewery, artist and concert venue to the search results

// Code Example? //
